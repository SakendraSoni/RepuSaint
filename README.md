# RepuSaint
In today's digital age, consumers constantly scrutinize brands through social media and online reviews. Understanding public perception and sentiment towards a brand is crucial for effective reputation management. The goal is to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool that can analyze vast amounts of text data from social media platforms and customer reviews. This tool will automatically detect and classify sentiments (positive, negative, neutral) to provide actionable insights into brand reputation. The insights gained will help brands monitor their public image, respond to customer feedback, and make informed decisions to enhance their reputation and customer satisfaction.
